# thesis_orion_omnet
code for Master's Thesis using OMNet Simulation framework

This code was utilized for my simulation of UAVs forming a distributed network, implementing a version of the ORION MANET query and transfer protocol.  The protocol is not fully implemented based on the the research paper, but only what aspects were needed to assess the effects of data replication on data availability in a UAV swarm.
